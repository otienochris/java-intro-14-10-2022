    /*
     * The Arithmetic Operators
     *
     *
     *  [+] (Addition)	    Adds values on either side of the operator.	                            A + B will give 30
     * [-] (Subtraction)	Subtracts right-hand operand from left-hand operand.	                A - B will give -10
     * [*] (Multiplication)	Multiplies values on either side of the operator.	                    A * B will give 200
     * [/] (Division)	    Divides left-hand operand by right-hand operand.	                    B / A will give 2
     * [%] (Modulus)	    Divides left-hand operand by right-hand operand and returns remainder.	B % A will give 0
     * [++] (Increment)	    Increases the value of operand by 1.	                                B++ gives 21
     * [--] (Decrement)	    Decreases the value of operand by 1.	                                B-- gives 19
     *
     *
     * The Relational Operators
     *
     *
     * [==] (equal to)	Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, if yes then condition becomes true.	                                                    (A == B) is not true.
     * [!=] (not equal to)	Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, if values are not equal then condition becomes true.	                                (A != B) is true.
     * [>]  (greater than)	Checks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.	                        (A > B) is not true.
     * [<]  (less than)	Checks if the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.	(                           A < B) is true.
     * [>=] (greater than or equal to)	Checks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.	(A >= B) is not true.
     * [<=] (less than or equal to)	Checks if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.	    (A <= B) is true.
